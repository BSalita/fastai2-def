Singularity .def file modified for building in a restricted signularity environment. Building a .sif file works. However, my ancient singularity installation doesn't support GPU or .sif. I concluded that Singularity wasn't worth the effort for my situation. I prefer Docker because it has a bigger eco-system, support for Windows and Mac, and frictionless installation. The disadvantages of Docker can be worked around or don't apply to my situation.
